# Description
This landing page project is the second in the frontend developer's final projects, which is a part of the frontend developer nanodegree program. It serves as an opportunity to showcase and apply the skills and knowledge gained throughout the program in creating a professional and engaging landing page.

I try to do everything the project Rubric requires, and not only that, I also want to make sure that I learn all the skills in this part and test this project
